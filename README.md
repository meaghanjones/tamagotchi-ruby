# Tamagotchi Ruby

#### By Meaghan Jones and Matt Guim

## Description

In the early 2000's, Tamagotchis were all the rage. They were handheld, digital pets that could be carried around on keychain-sized mini computers. They required loving care by pressing buttons to feed them, play with them, and put them to sleep. If you didn't give a Tamagotchi enough food, attention or rest, it would...alas...die.

We implemented the following features:
* Check on the pet and see how it's doing (is it still alive?!?)
* Feed it
* Put it to sleep

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Make sure  all the gem dependencies are bundled before running the app locally.

## Known Bugs

There are no known bugs.
